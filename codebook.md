Two datasets: Observational and Features

Observational dataset 
dataset variable: mn2
 
Subject -- a numeric factor 1-30 identifying the subject of the test

Activity --  six factors identifying the activity of the measurement:  walking, walking_upstairs, walking_downstairs, sitting, standing, laying

bodyaccx1-bodyaccx128 -- these variables capture the 128 measurements of the body accelerometer in the x dimension    

bodyaccy1-bodyaccy128 -- these variables capture the 128 measurements of the body accelerometer in the y dimension

bodyaccz1-bodyaccz128  -- these variables capture the 128 measurements of the body accelerometer in the z dimension

bodygyrox1-bodygyrox128  -- these variables capture the 128 measurements of the body gyroscope in the x dimension

bodygyroy1-bodygyroy128  -- these variables capture the 128 measurements of the body gyroscope in the y dimension

bodygyroz1-bodygyroz128  -- these variables capture the 128 measurements of the body gyroscope in the z dimension

totalaccx1-totalaccx128  -- these variables capture the 128 measurements of the total in the x dimension

totalaccy1-totalaccx128  -- these variables capture the 128 measurements of the total in the y dimension

totalaccz1-totalaccx128  -- these variables capture the 128 measurements of the total in the  dimension
